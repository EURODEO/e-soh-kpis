# Stakeholders

This section describes the KPIs that define the target from the perspective of the important stakeholders. 
Most important identified stakeholders are:
- RODEO project and partners
- EUMETNET, including FEMDI Expert Team 

Requirement F07 states that the EUMETNET members want monthly, quarterly, and annual reports of the performance, against (to be confirmed) agreed KPIs.

|ID|KPI|Description|Target|Notes|
|---|---|---|---|---|
|KPI-9|Number of data providing organisations|(Mainly) NMHSs providing data in E-SOH|31||
|KPI-10|Amount of Weather Stations available via the API|Combined with the providing organisations|No target value||

## Discussion

Internal use of the NMHSs need to be reported as a special case as it is in special interest of the EUMETNET Member States and providing organisations. The KPIs and the targe figures should be the same. 

KPI-9 target figure is derived from assumption that all EUMETNET Member States would provide data through E-SOH. 

KPI-10. There is an assumption that EUMETNET Members will provide data from as many automatic weather stations (AWS) as possible. This is in contrast to only a sub-set of the total number of AWS stations being shared through the GTS. The actual number of stations from each Member is are not know at present, but a KPI to reflect the inclusion of additional stations is highly desireable.
