|SH-4|Type of requests|Type of requests (API|bulk download)|-|No target value -- only for monitoring/reporting purposes|

## Discussion

Stake holder KPIs will support reporting the user and data provider uptake.

Most important identified stakeholders are:
- RODEO project and partners
- EUMETNET, including FEMDI Expert Team 

Internal use of the NMHSs need to be reported as a special case as it is in special interest of the EUMETNET Member States and providing organisations. The KPIs and the targe figures should be the same. 

SH-1 is important to tell that API is used and to report usage. The definite target figures are hard and possibly irrelevant to define. A time series of the number of requests and especially a long-term trend in the usage is particularly interesting. 

SH-2 is certainly interesting figure to report, but may be challenging to fetch if registration is not required and there's not advacned analytics capabilities in place. With advanced analytics, the metrics can also be deepened to geographic location of the users and to from which sector they are coming from.. 

SH-3 target figure is derived from assumption that all EUMETNET Member States would provide data through E-SOH. 

SH-4 is more monitoring type of metrics. However, the type of requests are valuable information for further development of the service.
