## Discussion

Stake holder KPIs will support reporting the user and data provider uptake.

Most important identified stakeholders are:
- RODEO project and partners
- EUMETNET, including FEMDI Expert Team 

Internal use of the NMHSs need to be reported as a special case as it is in special interest of the EUMETNET Member States and providing organisations. The KPIs and the targe figures should be the same. 

KPI-9 target figure is derived from assumption that all EUMETNET Member States would provide data through E-SOH.
