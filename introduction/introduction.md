# Introduction

This document defines KPIs for the E-SOH system. The target of the KPIs is to provide guidance for system design and operations to ensure correct level of availability and usability of the system and data. 

KPIs target to be as simple as possible, containing only few automatically collected metrics.

KPIs should not be confused with requirements nor monitoring. Requirements defines clear lower/upper bounds while KPIs target a goal. Monitoring is used to ensure that the system is operating as expected, to detect anomalies and to trace root cause of the potential problems.
